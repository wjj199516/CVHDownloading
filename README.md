# CVHDownloading

The script is used to download CVH (Chinese Virtual Herbarium) specimen records and store it to a txt file or Mysql database. Users could download specimen records providing taxonomy name or location and store it in a tab delimited file. Also they can download it using multiple threads providing urls firstly and store it in Mysql database, I have used it to download millions of specimen records.
